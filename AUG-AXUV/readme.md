# ASDEX Upgrade AXUV synthetic diagnostics

- Using Cherab [GitHub](https://github.com/cherab/core) and Raysect [GitHub](https://github.com/raysect/source)
- Option to use external input profiles from DREAM [GitHub](https://github.com/chalmersplasmatheory/DREAM)

## Note
The `create.py` file is modified compared to the normal Cherab installation to include photon emissivity coefficients for all Ne charge states. This file is located in `cherab/core/cherab/openadas/repository/`.
